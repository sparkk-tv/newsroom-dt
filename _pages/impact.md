>I am happy to share that the JP Morgan Python award at PyData London 2022 went to Gloria Macia, who gave a highly engaging explanation of the Data Umbrella project. The project's mission is to provide a welcoming and educational space for under-represented persons in the fields of machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. A great project I will look into in more detail. Thank you Gloria!"
