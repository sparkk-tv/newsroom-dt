*Data Umbrella works to increase participation of underrepresented persons in data science, open sources and Python from the regions of Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.

This article was recently published in the PLOS Journal by funders at CZI and the Sloan Foundation.  Data Umbrella received a mention in there for community building:  

*Groups like Outreachy, Data Umbrella, and PyLadies are all great examples of communities of practice that specialize in promoting and supporting underrepresented groups. Local communities of practice are also important: They have cultural, geographic, and human language expertise that can make open source interactions more welcoming for new participants from the area.*
